# Transform and enrich data seamlessly with AI functions (Preview)

[Transform and enrich data seamlessly with AI functions - Microsoft Fabric | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/ai-functions/overview?tabs=pandas#getting-started-with-ai-functionshttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/ai-functions/overview?tabs=pandas#getting-started-with-ai-functions)

Use of the AI functions library in a Fabric notebook currently requires certain custom packages. The following code installs and imports those packages. Afterward, you can use AI functions with pandas or PySpark, depending on your preference.

With Microsoft Fabric, all business professionals—from developers to analysts—can derive more value from their enterprise data through Generative AI, using experiences like [Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/copilot-notebooks-overview) and [AI skills](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/how-to-create-ai-skill). Thanks to a new set of AI functions for data engineering, Fabric users can now harness the power of industry-leading large language models (LLMs) to transform and enrich data seamlessly.

AI functions harness the power of GenAI for summarization, classification, text generation, and so much more—all with a single line of code:

- [**Calculate similarity with `ai.similarity`**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/ai-functions/overview?tabs=pandas#calculate-similarity-with-aisimilarity): Compare the meaning of input text with a single common text value, or with corresponding text values in another column.
- [**Categorize text with `ai.classify`**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/ai-functions/overview?tabs=pandas#categorize-text-with-aiclassify): Classify input text values according to labels you choose.
- [**Detect sentiment with `ai.analyze_sentiment`**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/ai-functions/overview?tabs=pandas#detect-sentiment-with-aianalyze_sentiment): Identify the emotional state expressed by input text.
- [**Extract entities with `ai.extract`**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/ai-functions/overview?tabs=pandas#extract-entities-with-aiextract): Find and extract specific types of information from input text, for example locations or names.
- [**Fix grammar with `ai.fix_grammar`**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/ai-functions/overview?tabs=pandas#fix-grammar-with-aifix_grammar): Correct the spelling, grammar, and punctuation of input text.
- [**Summarize text with `ai.summarize`**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/ai-functions/overview?tabs=pandas#summarize-text-with-aisummarize): Get summaries of input text.
- [**Translate text with `ai.translate`**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/ai-functions/overview?tabs=pandas#translate-text-with-aitranslate): Translate input text into another language.
- [**Answer custom user prompts with `ai.generate_response`**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/ai-functions/overview?tabs=pandas#answer-custom-user-prompts-with-aigenerate_response): Generate responses based on your own instructions.

It's seamless to incorporate these functions as part of data-science and data-engineering workflows, whether you're working with pandas or Spark. There is no detailed configuration, no complex infrastructure management, and no specific technical expertise needed.
